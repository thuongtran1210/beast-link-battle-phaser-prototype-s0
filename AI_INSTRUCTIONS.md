# AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md — Beast Link Battle Coding Agent

## Critical operational rule — REPO ONLY

For normal coding/implementation tasks in this repository:

**DO NOT call Notion MCP.**

The project owner wants coding agents to avoid Notion MCP usage to reduce connector limits.

Repository-local documentation is the synchronized operational source for coding.

Only query/update Notion when the user explicitly asks for a Notion documentation sync.

If repo docs and code conflict:
- inspect current code
- report the conflict
- do not invent missing behavior
- do not fetch Notion unless the user explicitly asks

## Current project state

- Current slice: **P1-V14G.3 — Tactical Energy Live Validation Gate**. ACTIVE LIVE VALIDATION / owner evidence required / NOT PASSED / Experimental / not adopted. No new Energy implementation is authorized in G.3.
- G.1 core is remote verified at `1102a0771c1c086a2bc85b30bd57c449877aba7d`.
- F.1c player-surface visual closeout remains a separate live screenshot gate.
- F.1 baseline is implemented on remote main at `8666a5eeb27c6bc4ef0ef9fdc918d23524adc5f8`; Energy cast reliability is complete, but owner screenshot shows remaining Setup visual closeout work.
- V14E Multi-Wave Resource Commitment Integration Validation: IMPLEMENTED / DETERMINISTIC EVIDENCE HARDENED / LIVE NOT RECORDED / EXPERIMENTAL / NOT ADOPTED. 70 deterministic checks pass. Controlled SAVE vs SPEND fixture verified; Energy policy ownership made explicit; Link Shard accounting corrected; divergence count aligned with harness output; production squad-cap constant verified.
- V14D Persistent Energy: `EnergyQueue` is Run-scoped; unused stored Energy persists across Waves. Reset only on Restart / new Run. No storage cap.
- V14C.1a.1 Timing State Hardening: Enforces strict terminal state rule: `ENDED → start()` is a NO-OP; `ENDED → update()` is a NO-OP; `remainingSeconds` stays 0; only `reset()` returns `ENDED → READY 12.0s`.
- V14C.1a First-Match Start Buffer: `READY → first valid match → ACTIVE 12.0s timer`. Invalid input does not start timer.
- P1-V14C.2 Link Shard: IMPLEMENTED / DETERMINISTIC PASS / EXPERIMENTAL / LIVE EVIDENCE OPEN.
- V14C.1 Combo Quality Signal: IMPLEMENTED / DETERMINISTIC PASS / OWNER-LIVE OPEN.
- V14B.3 STAR Consolidation: IMPLEMENTED / CODE REVIEW PASS / LIVE HYPOTHESIS OPEN.
- V14B.1/B.2 Run Roster & Attrition: CORE IMPLEMENTED / OWNER-LIVE EVIDENCE OPEN.
- Squad Capacity upgrades: NOT STARTED.
- V14 remains Experimental / not adopted.

## Implemented architecture baselines

- RunRoster unit identity, HP / KO persistence, per-Wave deployment reset: implemented.
- B.3 manual STAR consolidation: implemented; do not restore greedy recruitment conversion.
- C.1 Combo quality: implemented; do not restore +0.3 phase-time extension.
- C.2 Link Shard: implemented; preserve threshold, cap, persistence, assisted consolidation, and zero-phantom-HP rules.
- C.1a first-match timer start: implemented.
- C.1a.1 terminal timer state: implemented; `ENDED → start()` is a no-op.
- Active Squad cap remains 4.
- Formation Grid capacity remains independent of squad capacity.

## Active validation — P1-V14G.3 Tactical Energy Live Validation Gate

Purpose:

**Validate whether the implemented tactical Energy system is understandable in live play.**

Current implementation evidence:
- G.1 core implemented.
- G.2 player surface implemented.
- normal and Showcase Battle rows present identity → effect → activation state.
- ally cast feedback uses canonical Beast display names.
- G.2 deterministic checks are wired into `npm run check`.
- separate G.2.3 regression proves `MEND → SNOWGUARD +30`.
- Live evidence is NOT recorded.

G.3 rules:
- add no new tactical Energy mechanic;
- do not rebalance Energy;
- do not add Energy types;
- do not add cooldown;
- do not add manual target selection;
- do not add auto-cast;
- do not add cap or decay;
- deterministic PASS does not equal live PASS;
- only fix defects demonstrated by owner/browser evidence.

Live questions:
1. Can the player identify MEND / RESCUE / BREAK / PIERCE?
2. Can the player understand each effect?
3. Can the player distinguish READY / SUGGESTED / DISABLED?
4. Can the player understand why SUGGESTED appears?
5. Does cast feedback visibly connect to the actual target?
6. Does SUGGESTED remain guidance rather than forced action?
7. Does save-now-vs-later remain understandable across Waves?

Stop after live evidence review. V14G remains Experimental / not adopted.
